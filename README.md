# TETRIS
Hi this is my tetris game. It's a remake from the famous game tetris with some twists like:
- Scoring systems based on how fast you place the tetris!
- Gravity mode
- Holding a tetris
- Prefill mode: start a game with half the screen filled.
- Gravity mode: use gravity on tiny tetris cells (falling effects.)
- Tetris mode: a SPECIAL mode in the game.
- Setting music and sound.
Enjoy. <br>
